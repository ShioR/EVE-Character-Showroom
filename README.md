What is this?
-------------
EVE Character Showroom (ECS) is an EVE Online API based web app. Once it has been installed on a server, or a local
stack and a character has been added you can quickly view the skills of a character along with the ships that they
can currently fly. There is also a main section detailing the character in more detail.
