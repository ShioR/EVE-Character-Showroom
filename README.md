### I'm confused   
EVE Character Showroom (ECS) is an EVE Online API based web app. Once it has been installed on a server, or a local
stack and a character has been added you can quickly view the skills of a character along with the ships that they
can currently fly. There is also a main section detailing the character in more detail.  
  
For more information on the features, please see the [features](https://github.com/ShioR/EVE-Character-Showroom/wiki/Features) on our wiki.

### Notes    
You'll probably want to set us to *'Not watching'* rather *'Watching'* if you value your inbox. Sorry. If this isn't your cup of tea, give us a :star: instead!
